In Next.js 15, a subtle issue can arise when using the `getStaticPaths` function in conjunction with dynamic routes and middleware. If the middleware attempts to access data that is not yet available during the static path generation phase (e.g., data fetched from a database or external API), it may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. This can manifest as incomplete or missing data in the rendered pages.
