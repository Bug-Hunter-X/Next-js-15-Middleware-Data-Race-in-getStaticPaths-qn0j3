# Next.js 15 Middleware Data Race in getStaticPaths

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Next.js 15 when using middleware with `getStaticPaths`.  The problem occurs when middleware tries to access data that isn't ready during static path generation, leading to incomplete or missing data in rendered pages.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where middleware fetches data.  If this data isn't available during `getStaticPaths`, the paths generated will be incorrect, resulting in errors or missing content.

## Solution

`bugSolution.js` provides a solution.  Instead of directly accessing data in the middleware during `getStaticPaths`, we separate data fetching and path generation.  We fetch the data beforehand (e.g., in a separate function or API call) and use that data for path generation.
